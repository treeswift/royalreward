# Modena

Modena is a city in Italy.

## Running Modena

`build/mod <original-installation-path>`

Then answer questions, and the wizard will finally tell you where you should go — e.g., if your character's name is
Charlie, then, once you're in DOSBox, `cd Charlie` down from the original game directory and run the game as usual.
**Don't create your character again from within the game** — simply load the Modena-created save file (there will be
only one, and upon pressing 'L' the game will pick it up automatically).

## Known issues

1. Only the console interactive mode is currently available. Prospective command-line options have been documented,
but none (except for the installation path) has been implemented so far.
