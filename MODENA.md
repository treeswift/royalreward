# Modena

Modena is a city in Italy.

## Running Modena

`mod <original-installation-path>`

Then answer questions, and the wizard will finally tell you where you should go â€” e.g., if your character's name is Charlie,
then, once you're in DOSBox, `cd Charlie` down from the original game directory and run the game as usual.

## Known issues

1. Only the console interactive mode is currently available. Prospective command-line options have been documented,
but none (except the installation path) has been implemented so far.

2. Only the DOS version released in 1990 is currently supported. Modena is smart enough to unpack it if needed and only if
neede, but coordinate edits (fortress and port locations) are written at fixed offsets. More flexible logic is coming soon.
